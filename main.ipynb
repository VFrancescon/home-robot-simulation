    "1. Step 1 - generate simulation in 2d continous space (mesh points) (easish)\n",
    "* Parameters:\n",
    "    * nr tables\n",
    "    * nr objects\n",
    "    * nr objects per table?\n",

    "    * rooms? walls?\n",
    "    * shape of objects ?\n",
    "    * Assume always the same size of the room. Add parameter for the scale of the room - that's gonna have a massive impact on the computational power\n",

    "    * robot\n",
    "    * tables\n",
    "    * object (sub-different colours fot different shapes?)\n",

    "1. Graph the current situation\n",
    "2. Given current state of simulation - run TAMP algorithm (or is that just going to be Task Planning, without mobile manipulation, since we're assuming \"magic\" pick/place?. It's just a matter of definition/language interpretation I think)\n",
